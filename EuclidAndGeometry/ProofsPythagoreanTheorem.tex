\maketitle

The website linked below has a number of different proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem.  

You should read the introduction, and then pick a few of these proofs to study.  You do not need to know all of the proofs on this site!  You should be able to give, in full detail, the proof from our textbook (which is also Proof \#1 on the site) as well as two other proofs of your choice.
